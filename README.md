## What ⚡
Script to clean up OutlineWiki's default exports creating within the app to Obsidian format. 
## Why 🤷‍♂️
- Might be nice to know if you export from Outline that it's ready for Obsidian and generally cleaned up. 
- Cuts down on proprietary decisions from Outline
## How 📋
- Loop though dir and apply multiple transformations
- Allow users to turn on or off each of these things in a CONFIG.ini file inside the convertor. 

### Actions

#### Done ✅
1. Remove H1 at the top✅
2. Remove extra spacing between sections and "\" in lines✅
3. Convert info boxes from Outline format of ":::" to standard format using ">"✅
4. Add function to loop through dir and apply to full export✅

#### Do

4. Convert full links to Wikilinks -- will end up being an issue if embedded in large Obsidian where a conflict exists but otherwise could be could. (Added this but have not full tested ... )
